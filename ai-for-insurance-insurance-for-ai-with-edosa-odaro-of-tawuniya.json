I'm Matthew D'Amelio, Senior Editor here at Emerge Technology Research. Today's guest on the program is Edosa Odaro, Chief of Data Analytics and Privacy Officer at Tawanea, former Chief Data Officer at AIG, and the author of two books on overcoming data challenges. For the first of a two-episode appearance on the program, Edosa joins us on today's show to talk about data challenges in the insurance space. Our conversation ranges from how insurance leaders can more efficiently close the service gaps between their sector and the rest of financial services, which Edosa sees as being farther ahead in terms of using AI capabilities, to the considerations business leaders need to keep in mind when pursuing insurance for business solutions utilizing AI. It's a lot to cover, so we have a stacked show for you ahead. Without further ado, here's our conversation. Edosa, thank you so much for being with us on the program today. Well, thank you, Matthew, for having me here. So to start off, given your wide background in this industry, what do you see as the biggest challenges currently facing the insurance space, given the current state of AI adoption? Oh, my goodness. I know, I know. Where do we start with that? Look, it's from my standpoint, I've had so much experience with insurance, and I think that, yeah, I don't think anyone in insurance would be surprised when we kind of say insurance is behind, it's behind in many ways. But the thing about it is that, you know, it is behind, and it's clear, but a huge amount of opportunity within insurance in terms of these cases, and in terms of what AI can now provide, right, and now provide within the space as well. So I mean, the state of insurance, it's nowhere near where it needs to be. You know, we compare insurance to, you know, I suppose you can call this little cousin in banking. Yes. It's nowhere near what banking has become within this space, within AI, within digital community. So it's a huge amount of opportunity there. Absolutely. And when we look at banking, they're further along in the customer experience areas, they're further along in a lot of compliance respects. There's also the factor, and we'll get into this a little bit later into the show, just in terms of, you know, the challenges. Now you have businesses developing AI products, and those need to be insured. And you know, obviously, AI capabilities go into that. And they're also about AI capabilities themselves. So I think that ends up into a situation. And we're finding this, you know, even across sectors into the other areas that we cover on the show, which is that usually sometimes the biggest solution for certain AI problems is other forms of AI. And this can feel confusing to someone or business leaders who might think of artificial intelligence in a monolith. But no, especially long term, long time listeners of the show know there are several different forms of artificial intelligence. We're going to be getting into even more in our next episode where we boil down your book's value driven data and your first book, Making Data Work, but we'll save that for that next episode. Just in terms of what you're seeing in terms of where insurance is behind banking, what do you see as the biggest gaps? And how are insurance firms thinking about closing those gaps going into the future? Yeah, when you look at where banking is, I think it's a good sort of, you know, I suppose at this point, banking has transformed from this thing where you kind of had this sort of very hands off, your arms length of relationship between banks and customers was all about, you know, you come around and get a loan and go away and pay back. And I think insurance has come a long way to bridge that gap as well in that actually what insurance companies have been talking about for a while has really been about this payer to partner type thing, right? But actually, when you think about the payer to partner, really what it's trying to do, of course, it's going to increase engagement. You want to have that kind of hand holding and with you in the journey. But actually, how much value is that in itself creatively? It's great to have an insurance product, which is like motor insurance, my health insurance, and a couple of messages here and there to say, hello, you know, I'm your insurer, you know, log on to your app, you know, but ultimately, I think the real, you know, I suppose, Nirvana, if you like, for insurance companies is to really get into value, you know, to the access services where you can really, you know, you're something that your customers actually want to interact with as opposed to being pushed on them. I think that's where the real opportunities are in kind of value based additional services that insurance can actually provide. And I know that that's especially where banking's farther along the journey. You talk to other folks in financial services and they talk about, you know, the call center going from playing goalie, being on the defense, being reactive to a sense of proactivity in getting to the point where, you know, what the customer's talking or going to call about before they call about it. You spoke a lot in your last answer about how just the relationship is fundamentally different between a bank and a customer, even if that's changing rapidly and everybody in banking will say thanks to technology. Yes, that relationship is changing. But just in terms of the traditional relationship with insurance, how should leaders envision that relationship to have the closest proximity to the customer, even if they can't full on predict, you know, what they're going to call into per se, or can they? Oh, I'll leave the second question to later. Sure. But I think fundamentally, think about what it is that we all want, you and I want from the insurance company. So I think, you know, I think insurance at a point was too much focused on the front end of insurance, which is all around the sales and several policies, whether that's really around profitability or is around growth. It was all within the front of the house is even in terms of, you know, I suppose more recent transformations, very much digital focus, very much at focus very much. And I think, ultimately, from a customer standpoint, what is the customers want when you and I want is actually the claim side to be how do you look after me in those situations where I suffer a loss or I fall into certain types of difficulties. And I think really what happens there, when you look at what happens in banking, we look at what happens actually in other industries more broadly, fundamentally, there's a seed element to all of it, right? So you don't want to be sitting on the phone, you know, knowing that your core is important to us. You want that instant service, if possible, like you sort of alluded to in some ways, would you actually be proactive, actually kind of step ahead of the game and either detect challenges or beyond that actually prevent challenge? But that's as much broader space to delve into. But actually, fundamentally, just that, you know, the reactivity, just the reaction side around this has happened, I just had an accident, I just had a mental, whatever that thing is, but the reaction time to those events really can be sped up significantly. Something else I've discerned from my conversations with insurance leaders and even banking leaders in reverse, just looking at how they do things and noticing how it is in insurance is a slight trend kind of pop up when it comes to service tunnels in terms of securing both, you know, from a, if we're talking about FinServe, you know, a know your customer or AML perspective, or at least being able to verify all the information about a consumer from the first time that they touch a pipeline. And when I talk to insurance leaders, they often say that this is incredibly important insurance, not even just for the compliance side of knowing the customer, but at least for insurance, the more you know about the customer, the more you'll be able to be able to build in those functions that are more predictive, the more you'll be able to understand their circumstances and the potential risks involved with the customer variables down the line in terms of, you know, what claim do they want? What do they want to ensure? Is that something that you're finding in the insurance space as well? That first touch with the customer, you know, from a data perspective is a hugely important moment. We've likened it, when we talk about it, we compare it to checking IDs at the door. Like there's a bouncer in a club and it's so, so important that the minute the customer gets to the door, that's when you want to frisk them, so to speak. You want to make that you want to give them the full readout then. I see you nodding, but is there a new emphasis in onboarding with these technologies for the insurance space that we just haven't seen before? No, absolutely. Absolutely. I think, you know, I think about it as both from a front of house standpoint, when it comes to actually onboarding the whole new business cycle or whether that be even a renewal cycle. It's fundamental with things like straight through processing, which is a big area within insurance at the moment, is traditional insurance. You come in, you quote, you get underwritten and then you get something at the other end. There's a huge focus now on how can we funnel a lot more through straight through processing, which actually gets you those answers very quickly. The challenge with that, of course, is that as you start trying to increase the speed of new business and onboarding new customers, you increase the risk potentially of things like fraud on the other end. And so fundamentally then, actually you need to bring, you know, big sort of technologies in to actually mitigate that risk. And then on the other end, which I think is the bit I sort of alluded to before, the claims side of things, again, you have a similar sort of situation there. And this time we're looking at claims at the point, sort of a fraud point of claim. Fundamentally you want to speed up claims, but actually in doing that, you open the door potentially then for fraud at that point. So it's a huge element there, interaction between I want to get this done, I want to be quicker, but actually how do I ensure that that's done within a low risk framework? Right, right. And when you're doing that checking IDs at the door, that's the fastest way to ensure security of the rest of the pipeline. You don't have to go rechecking over and over again. That efficiency is already built in. But there, and I think this is really insurance, really interesting, and we see this all over the insurance space, right there is an example of a policy where it's not really data that's the solution. They haven't invented anything new, but rather that the information and the tools that are already there, they're relatively new. Maybe they go back to a little bit before pandemic, but they're still in that family of recent AI capabilities. But they've been around for a little bit, so they're not surprising anymore, but they're building in these policies, like what I call checking IDs at the door, and these new practices and these changes in workflows, where are we seeing workflows change for insurance as data is helping to solve these problems? Look, there's a couple of things there. So I think the one thing is on the surface, it seems not much change, right? It's all about increasing speed, doing more or less the same thing. I think fundamentally, in doing that, you need to consider how you potentially behind the scenes actually refactor processes. And by that, what I mean is, if you think about how, for instance, claims work, there's a first notification of claim, and then there is something else around there that lives around is this fraudulent, is this whatever else, right? That whole process, end to end, needs to be re-engineered to think about how do we take bits out? And that's what I talk about, when I talk about speed, it's not only about pushing harder, it's not only about adding horsepower, it's not only about just adding compute power to processing. A lot of times, what increases speed is actually taking things out, starting friction out of the system, and in doing so, a lot of times that is really just taking steps out. How can you actually do that? The other element to it is, there are lots of, and I think it's a big confusion for a lot of people, because people think doing more, doing better, I mean, it's more data, and you're absolutely right in thinking that it's not necessarily more data. And I think there's a whole confusion around this whole idea of big data, big people with compression, there's gotta be big guys doing more. It's actually really, from my perspective, you could be looking at the same data set and using it in a more intelligent sort of way, and using better techniques to actually utilize that same data set. So you're fundamentally right in saying that it's not necessarily new stuff, but it's potentially looking at old stuff in a different sort of way. I'm wondering if you have an example in that last one, because I hear over and over again across industries that you have this problem of a lot of the IT or the data side will be like, we just need more info, we need more info, we need more haystack so we can get more needles, but there already might be needles in there, and maybe you just need to be, it might be a more efficient use of your time to examine the hay that you already have for more needles. You could get more needles that way than just getting simply more hay, sticking with a haystack needle analogy. Keeping it simple, keeping it down to the farm. But I think from your saying, it's just like, no, no, you need to be smarter about finding the, let that be the first indication. Do you have an example there of maybe a circumstance that a lot of insurance leaders run into where the solution isn't more data, but looking at it in a more efficient way? Well, absolutely, I think that one of the big challenges I find is that when, I suppose insurance leaders look at the space of AI and the first thing you think about is, we don't have adequate data quality as an example. And because you haven't got adequate data quality, you can't actually get much out of AI. But actually, what I find is that if you focus first on the problems you're actually trying to solve, actually working your way backwards, you find that actually first things is a lot of times you've got the data you need, you've actually got the actual ETB within that. And the other part is you look at it and actually fundamentally, a lot of people think about quality as this thing that has got to be the 100%, they got it or I don't. But it's a sliding scale. And actually, what you can do, a big part of what a lot of people actually missed out is that you need to fundamentally look at what's the impact of the level of quality that I have and what I'm trying to do. And actually, there's a whole range of things you can then do in terms of looking fundamentally at the outcomes you're trying to get to and measuring against the inputs. So I think we're hitting it there in terms of it's not necessarily getting new stuff, you get new stuff, you get new data sets. It's not wrong to go out and get new data sets, but you fundamentally see problems in that you have quality problems, you have issues around what is it my fundamental, where am I trying to get to? And so I think the biggest has got to be first on use case, what is it I'm actually trying to solve and then what the market is. Absolutely. Another subject I wanted to turn to in a very multifaceted episode now that we've kind of covered how AI is working in the insurance space alone. Insurance is a huge part of our lives. Insurance needs to ensure problems. AI is among the facets of life that we need insurance products for. Given where we're looking at AI vendors, I think there's an even broader scope to this question given how even everyday businesses are going to have their own large language models, their own bespoke models. And I'm wondering if we can get a sense of how are insurers going to look at AI products, AI based business models going into the future and how is that groundwork being laid right now in your view? I think one of the biggest problems that I find is obviously, again, of course, with that GPT, the sale of type around this. And it's one of those situations where there's a big temptation for problems, shall I say for solutions to go around looking for problems to solve. And that is a big danger for insurance. I think what I'm finding that the big brains in insurance instead are looking at what kinds of use cases, what kind of models should I be shifting my business towards? For instance, a good example would be a lot of insurance now. It's time to think about things like driverless cars. What does that mean for motor? What does that mean for where we need to be going with insurance products around mobility, around motor? There's another real big drive here around really looking beyond the core of an insurance business, which is again, moving away from this idea of a partner, that's a shift from pay as partner to actually looking more at if you like vertical integrations, so looking at how much more can I do, for instance, in healthcare as an example? Can I shift from just being the gatekeeper between I'm well and I'm now ill and just to be in that care to the provider? Can I start to create a different kind of value proposition? Perhaps that's something around improving the outcome of care or whether that's actually shifting to the prevention side. What can I do to actually shift you along and actually avoid you getting chronic inverse blitz? That's area of opportunity. I think when you look at it from that perspective, things like LLMs and everything else around the AI become potential solutions to solve many problems. Indeed. Let's say you're leveraging those solutions into your business model or just straight up an AI vendor that wants to revolutionize these spaces. You're making the technology to do it. How should you prepare for your product to be insured when you're going into those meetings and you're looking to level up as a business? Yeah. I think you can look at... Interestingly, I think there's a new phase now where we are actually starting to see actual products out there to ensure AI. That's an interesting trajectory in some ways. I think with a lot of organizations, and I think there's two parts to that. There's ensuring from a vendor standpoint, isn't there? I'm a vendor. I'm actually an AI product provider. I can look at how can I give you or provide my clients or potential clients with a level of confidence in that this is likely to actually work. Of course, the complication around AI working isn't really the traditional technology idea of throwing it over the fence and hoping for the best. It actually needs to keep working and not to the deviated from its subject. I think that's the vendor perspective. There's a lot of AI clearly obviously being developed in-house as well. That requires a lot of confidence for leaders and executives to actually see that to fruition. I think that fundamentally is one of the big issues that a lot of data scientists and chief data officers, et cetera, actually find because how do you provide any level of confidence to your stakeholders that this thing, this fancy AI thing is actually likely to work and actually perhaps even more importantly, not negative impacts to actually happen within your organization. I think it's almost going back to the why is this product actually needed, why AI insurance products are actually needed. I think fundamentally, it's really about this level of certainty that a lot of organizations face. Yes, and I'm wondering if there's anything at least that they need to have beforehand or at least if they haven't put in this groundwork yet. We can narrow it down to AI vendors if we want to be more specific and leave the in-house folks out. Any advice at least for AI vendors in terms of getting their products insured that they should have prepared going into those meetings or at least in trying to seek out an insurer for their products? It's interesting. It's almost like with any insurance proposition, shall I say, in terms of an insurer taking on a level of risk. The more you can demonstrate your oversight around the risk that you're carrying, the better that situation actually is. The way you fundamentally need to do that is, first of all, you need to understand the risks yourself. You need to be able to measure that risk that you're carrying. That works really both from a vendor standpoint, but also from an internal AI function standpoint. Understand the risk you're carrying. Understand how do I measure that? How do I predict it? How do I estimate how much I'm carrying? Whether that's risk related, of course, in insurance, that's what we're talking about, but also in terms of the upside as well. If I assume that's in this AI piece that you're looking at, how should I estimate that value? I think that's fundamentally understanding measurement, but also understanding tracking. How do I put frameworks in place to enable me to continue to actually track the estimates that I've actually put forward actually do happen? If you're a vendor, you're able to do that, you're able to consistently demonstrate that, you take that risk to an insurer, you become an investor. It becomes a seller's market for you. You're basically sitting there, able to almost pick and choose who you want to deal with. It's because you have that coverage. You understand how much value you're creating there. It's important to do that. Absolutely. Once again, very important, just as we were saying before in terms of data and haystacks and needles, it's not about having more hay. It's about being able to look at the data that you have in the right way to bring the important data points to the top, no matter what the situation is, including situations where you're trying to get your AI vendor product insured. Eidosa, thank you so much for being with us for this first episode. Everyone tune in. We're going to really dive in next time and talk about your new book, Value Driven Data. We'll have everybody at least on board for that. Thank you so much, Eidosa, for being with us today on the program. You're most welcome. It's a very enjoyable episode. Thank you. Before wrapping up today's episode, I think the best introduction I can give to the next episode or at least a part of today's conversation that I think will be very, very helpful and we're going to explore in spades on the next program is what Eidosa and I talked about in terms of not looking for more haystacks or more data or bigger data, but rather looking at the haystacks you have in a smarter way to get even more needles out of them. I know this space is rife with metaphors. Part of the reason that our head of research, Daniel Fagela, hired me is because I tend to be pretty good at them, whether we're talking about hammers in search of a nail or haystacks in search of a needle. But I think that point in general, not that more data means more power, but rather how you're looking at the data and what problem are you trying to solve with the data? What purpose is this data serving? Looking critically at questions in those ways, I think is going to make all the difference. And tune into our next show as we really dive into what that means and Eidosa's experience in making it happen. On behalf of Daniel and the entire team here at Emerge Technology Research, thanks so much for joining us today and we'll catch you next time on the AI in Business Podcast.", "episode_summary": "In this podcast episode, the guest Edosa Odaro, Chief of Data Analytics and Privacy Officer at Tawanea and former Chief Data Officer at AIG, discusses the challenges facing the insurance industry in adopting AI.
